Noasis Privacy Notice

Information We Collect and Share When You’re In a Room
Information You Share With Us and Other Participants
We need certain information to operate Noasis. For example, we need information about your account in order to save your avatar. Here’s the information we may receive from you:

Account information: You don’t need an account to use Noasis. However, certain features (like storing your avatar), require an account. If you create an account with your email address, we store a hashed version of your email address.

Room Name and URL: Rooms and room names are publicly accessible to anyone with the URL. Metaversy stores the name and the URL for the link you share so you and others with the link to the Room can use it again.

Avatar data: Your selected avatar and name will be shared with other participants in your room. If you’re logged in to your account, we will store your avatar. If you’re not logged into your account, we will not store your avatar.

Voice data: If your microphone is on, Noasis sends the audio to other users in the room. Metaversy does not store the audio; we only receive it temporarily to transmit it to others in the room.

Chat: If you send messages in Noasis, Noasis shares it with the other users in the room. Metaversy does not store chats; we only receive it temporarily to transmit it to others in the room.

Photos and Videos You Take, and Photos, Videos, and Objects You Upload: If you take photos and video in a Noasis room or upload photos, videos, or objects to a room, Metaversy stores them so you can share them within the room. They are deleted within 72 hours unless you pin them. If you pin them they will be stored until you remove them from the room and they will be viewable by anyone who can access the room.
